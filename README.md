# Running the Scraper

Scrapy is mainly designed for web scraping and provides a framework written in Python to do web-crawling. I find an opportunity to do multiple tasks through Scrapy on a website with many different pages. Here you see the work that Scrapy is capable of teaching us about what it can offer to help us use it in an unique way for different purposes and goals. From this repository, you will see not only the sophisticating technique of the use of Scrapy in Python (the IDE, PyCharm is used), but also the personal experience and opinion about what I have discovered from this utility.
